# stage-discharge_Cannon-Welch

 River stage and discharge for the Cannon River at Welch, Minnesota, along with double-Manning rating curve and nearby grain-size data.

 ## Contents

 * Stage&ndash;discharge data
 * Double-Manning files
 * Grain-size data from the tributary confluence at Welch; this is just above the gauge and is likely a bit coarser because it incorporates significant material from the tributary fan.
   * Measurement location: 44.35912&deg;N; -93.25183&deg;W
